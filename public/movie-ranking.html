<h1>The Best Movies According to Eze</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The monkey king</h3>
<p>Animated movies take so much time to create,so i have learnt to
     love good anmie movies.This particular movie talks about 
     berayal,loyalty,friendship,pride,rejection,repentance and 
     many more.I suggest this movie for kids because they will
    learn so much from it.</p>
<h3>Ozarks</h3>
<p>Just as they say"power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely"
    also dirty money corrupts and lot of dirty money corrupts a lot.
    This movie is about a man who helps a drug cartel to launder
    drug money while also making lots of money from the process.His 
    family gets mixed in the whole process and things gets messy that 
    their lives are endangered.This movie has so much lessons on the 
    disadvantages of a life of crime.

<h3>Living in bondage</h3>
<p>When it comes to wealth,power and fame, so many people are willing
    to pay what ever price it would take for them to get it.Even if 
    it involves killing someone for it.This movie is about a poor man 
    who ends up killing his beloved wife for money rituals so that he could 
    live a flabouyant lifestyle.After the deed was done,so many spiritual repercurssions 
    surfaced making his new wealthy life an uncomfortable one.
